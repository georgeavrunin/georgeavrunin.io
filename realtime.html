 Analyzing partially-implemented real-time systems.
 <em>IEEE Trans. Softw. Eng.</em>, 24(8):602&#x2013;614, August 1998.

  appearing in the <em>Proceedings of the International Conference on
  Software Engineering</em>, 1997.).

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Most analysis methods for real-time systems assume
that all the components of the system are at roughly the same stage of
development and can be expressed in a single notation, such as a
specification or programming language.  There are, however, many
situations in which developers would benefit from tools that could
analyze partially-implemented systems, those for which some components
are given only as high-level specifications while others are fully
implemented in a programming language.  In this paper, we propose a
method for analyzing such partially-implemented real-time systems.
Here we consider real-time concurrent systems for which some
components are implemented in Ada and some are partially specified
using regular expressions and Graphical Interval Logic (GIL), a
real-time temporal logic.  We show how to construct models of the
partially-implemented systems that account for such properties as
run-time overhead and scheduling of processes, yet support tractable
analysis of nontrivial programs.  The approach can be fully automated,
and we illustrate it by analyzing a small example.

 Automated derivation of time bounds in uniprocessor concurrent

 <em>IEEE Trans. Softw. Eng.</em>, 20(9):708&#x2013;719, September 1994.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
The successful development of complex real-time systems
depends on analysis techniques that can accurately assess the timing
properties of those systems.  This paper describes a technique for deriving
upper and lower bounds on the time that can elapse between two given events
in an execution of a concurrent software system running on a single
processor under arbitrary scheduling.  The technique involves generating
linear inequalities expressing conditions that must be satisfied by all
executions of such a system and using integer programming methods to find
appropriate solutions to the inequalities.  The technique does not require
construction of the state space of the system and its feasibility has been
demonstrated by using an extended version of the constrained expression
toolset to analyze the timing properties of some concurrent systems with
very large state spaces.

 A practical technique for bounding the time between events in
  concurrent real-time systems.
 In Thomas Ostrand and Elaine Weyuker, editors, <em>Proceedings of
  the 1993 International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA)</em>,
  pages 110&#x2013;116, Cambridge, MA, June 1993. ACM Press.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Showing that concurrent systems satisfy timing
constraints on their behavior is difficult, but may be essential for
critical applications.  Most methods are based on some form of
reachability analysis and require construction of a state space of
size that is, in general, exponential in the number of components in
the concurrent system.  In an earlier paper with L. K. Dillon and
J. C. Wileden, we described a technique for finding bounds on the time
between events without enumerating the state space, but the technique
applies chiefly to the case of logically concurrent systems executing
on a uniprocessor, in which events do not overlap in time.  In this
paper, we extend that technique to obtain upper bounds on the time
between events in maximally parallel concurrent systems.  Our method
does not require construction of the state space and the results of
preliminary experiments show that, for at least some systems with
large state spaces, it is quite tractable.  We also briefly describe
the application of our method to the case in which there are multiple
	processors, but several processes run on each processor.

 Sharpening bounds on the time between events in maximally parallel
  systems.
 Technical Report 92-69, Department of Computer Science, University of
  Massachusetts at Amherst, 1992.
<blockquote><font size="-1">
 A recent paper describes a method for obtaining
bounds on the time that can elapse between two given events in an
execution of a concurrent software system running on a single
processor under arbitrary scheduling.  The technique involves
generating linear inequalities expressing conditions that must be
satisfied by all executions of such a system and using integer
programming methods to find appropriate solutions to the inequalities.
Corbett has extended this approach to obtain upper bounds on the time
between events in executions of multi-processor concurrent systems in
which each process proceeds unless forced to wait to communicate with
another, the case of <em>maximal parallelism</em>, and processes
communicate by synchronous message passing.  Corbett's method does not
strictly enforce the maximal parallelism assumption, however, and may
thus give poor (though valid) bounds in some cases.  In this paper, I
	show how to modify Corbett's method to obtain sharper bounds.
