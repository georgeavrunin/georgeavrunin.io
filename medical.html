This paper explains how a detailed, precise surgical
                  process model can help reduce errors by fostering
                  better understanding, providing guidance during
                  surgery, helping train newcomers, and by supporting
                  process improvement.  It describes the features that
                  a process-modeling language should have in
                  order to support the precise specification of such
                  models.

Surgical team processes are known to be complex and
                  error prone. This paper describes an approach that
                  uses a detailed, validated model of a medical
                  process to provide the clinicians who carry out that
                  complex process with offline and online guidance to
                  help reduce errors. Offline guidance is in the form
                  of a hypertext document describing all the ways the
                  process can be carried out. Online guidance is in
                  the form of a context-sensitive and continually
                  updated electronic “checklist” that lists next steps
                  and needed resources, as well as completed steps. In
                  earlier work, we focused on providing such guidance
                  for single-clinician or single-team processes. This
                  paper describes guiding the collaboration of
                  multiple teams of clinicians through complex
                  processes with significant concurrency, complicated
                  exception handling, and precise and timely
                  communication. We illustrate this approach by
                  applying it to a highly complex, high risk
                  subprocess of cardiac surgery.

This paper summarizes the accomplishments and recent
                  directions of our medical safety project. Our
                  process-based approach uses a detailed,
                  rigorously-defined, and carefully validated process
                  model to provide a dynamically updated,
                  context-aware and thus, “Smart” Checklist to help
                  process performers understand and manage their
                  pending tasks [7]. This paper focuses on support for
                  teams of performers, working independently as well
                  as in close collaboration, in stressful situations
                  that are life critical. Our recent work has three
                  main thrusts: provide effective real-time guidance
                  for closely collaborating teams; develop and
                  evaluate techniques for measuring cognitive load
                  based on biometric observations and human surveys;
                  and, using these measurements plus analysis and
                  discrete event process simulation, predict cognitive
                  load throughout the process model and propose
                  process modifications to help performers better
                  manage high cognitive load situations. <p>
                  This project is a collaboration among software
                  engineers, surgical team members, human factors
                  researchers, and medical equipment instrumentation
                  experts. Experimental prototype capabilities are
                  being built and evaluated based upon process models
                  of two cardiovascular surgery processes, Aortic
                  Valve Replacement (AVR) and Coronary Artery Bypass
                  Grafting (CABG). In this paper we describe our
                  approach for each of the three research thrusts by
                  illustrating our work for heparinization, a common
                  subprocess of both AVR and CABG. Heparinization is a
                  high-risk error-prone procedure that involves
                  complex team interactions and thus highlights the
                  importance of this work for improving patient
                  outcomes.

 Development of an interactive dashboard to analyze cognitive workload
  of surgical teams during complex procedural care.
 In <em>2018 IEEE Conference on Cognitive and Computational Aspects
  of Situation Management (CogSIMA)</em>, pages 77&#x2013;82, 2018.
<blockquote><font size="-1">
In the surgical setting, team members constantly
                  deal with a high-demand operative environment that requires
                  simultaneously processing a large amount of
                  information. In certain situations, high demands
                  imposed by surgical tasks and other sources may
                  exceed team member’s cognitive capacity, leading to
                  cognitive overload which may place patient safety at
                  risk. In the present study, we describe a novel
                  approach to integrate an objective measure of team
                  member’s cognitive load with procedural, behavioral
                  and contextual data from real-life cardiac
                  surgeries. We used heart rate variability analysis,
                  capturing data simultaneously from multiple team
                  members (surgeon, anesthesiologist and perfusionist)
                  in a real-time and unobtrusive manner. Using
                  audio-video recordings, behavioral coding and a
                  hierarchical surgical process model, we integrated
                  multiple data sources to create an interactive
                  surgical dashboard, enabling the analysis of the
                  cognitive load imposed by specific steps, substeps
                  and/or tasks. The described approach enables us to
                  detect cognitive load fluctuations over time, under
                  specific conditions (e.g. emergencies, teaching) and
                  in situations that are prone to errors. This
                  in-depth understanding of the relationship between
                  cognitive load, task demands and error occurrence is
                  essential for the development of cognitive support
                  systems to recognize and mitigate errors during
                  complex surgical care in the operating room.

In this article, we present an approach for
                  systematically improving complex processes,
                  especially those involving human agents, hardware
                  devices, and software systems. We illustrate the
                  utility of this approach by applying it to part of
                  an election process and show how it can improve the
                  security and correctness of that subprocess. We use
                  the Little-JIL process definition language to create
                  a precise and detailed definition of the
                  process. Given this process definition, we use two
                  forms of automated analysis to explore whether
                  specified key properties, such as security and
                  safety policies, can be undermined. First, we use
                  model checking to identify process execution
                  sequences that fail to conform to event-sequence
                  properties. After these are addressed, we apply
                  fault tree analysis to identify when the
                  misperformance of steps might allow undesirable
                  outcomes, such as security breaches. The results of
                  these analyses can provide assurance about the
                  process; suggest areas for improvement; and, when
                  applied to a modified process definition, evaluate
                  proposed changes.

To reduce the probability of failures and to improve
                  outcomes of safety-critical human-intensive
                  processes, such as health care processes, it is
                  important to be able to rigorously analyze such
                  processes. The quality of that analysis often
                  depends on having an accurate, detailed, and
                  sufficiently complete understanding of the process
                  being analyzed, where this understanding is
                  typically represented as a formal process model that
                  could then drive various rigorous analysis
                  approaches. Developing this understanding and the
                  corresponding formal process model may be difficult
                  and, thus, a variety of process elicitation methods
                  are often used. The work presented in this paper
                  evaluates the effectiveness of five common
                  elicitation methods in terms of their ability to
                  elicit detailed process information necessary to
                  support rigorous process analysis. These methods are
                  employed to elicit typical steps and steps for
                  responding to exceptional situations in a
                  safety-critical health care process, the
                  chemotherapy treatment plan review process. The
                  results indicate strengths and weaknesses of each of
                  the elicitation methods and suggest that it is
                  preferable to apply multiple elicitation methods.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
This paper presents a systematic, incremental
                  approach to identifying vulnerabilities in models of
                  complex processes. The approach builds upon Fault
                  Tree Analysis (FTA), but enhances it to deliver
                  superior results. FTA has been applied to process
                  models to determine what combinations of events can
                  lead to a specified hazard —an undesired process
                  outcome. Such combinations, called cut sets, provide
                  valuable insights into process vulnerabilities, and
                  thus, are useful for improving process
                  robustness. Manual FTA can be tedious and
                  error-prone. Results of previous automated FTA work,
                  however, are incomplete as they fail to recognize
                  some vulnerabilities. Also, they often do not
                  provide enough information to understand the real
                  vulnerabilities, or they provide too many cut sets
                  to be helpful, especially when processes are large
                  and complex. Our approach takes into account
                  processes data and control dependences to generate
                  more thorough results. It supports selective
                  vulnerability exploration by initially presenting
                  users with cut sets for a high-level, and thus
                  smaller, fault tree; users can then select a cut set
                  for more detailed analysis, culminating in concrete
                  scenarios which show how events in the cut set could
                  lead to the hazard. Our approach also produces more
                  precise results by automatically eliminating
                  inconsistent and spurious cut sets.

Human errors are a major concern in many medical

                  investigating an approach for automatically
                  detecting when performers of a medical process
                  deviate from the acceptable ways of performing that
                  process as specified by a detailed process
                  model. Such deviations could represent errors and,
                  thus, detecting and reporting deviations as they
                  occur could help catch errors before harm is
                  done. In this paper, we identify important issues
                  related to the feasibility of the proposed approach
                  and empirically evaluate the approach for two
                  medical procedures, chemotherapy and blood
                  transfusion. For the evaluation, we use the process
                  models to generate sample process executions that we
                  then seed with synthetic errors. The process models
                  describe the coordination of activities of different
                  process performers in normal, as well as exceptional
                  situations. The evaluation results suggest that the
                  proposed approach could be applied in clinical
                  settings to help catch errors before harm is done.

Preventable adverse events related to surgery
                  account for two thirds of hospital
                  complications. Adherence to recommended processes of
                  care has been suggested as a strategy to improve
                  patient safety in surgery. This paper presents
                  preliminary work that is exploring the use of a
                  semantically rich process-modelling notation to
                  describe and inform critical phases of common
                  procedures in cardiac surgery. This work focuses on
                  reducing stokes, a catastrophic and often
                  preventable adverse event. The well-defined
                  semantics of the process-modelling notation allow
                  rigorous analysis techniques to be applied. In our
                  work, model checking is applied to determine if the
                  process as defined by the process model always
                  adheres to event sequence requirements and
                  fault-tree analysis is applied to determine where
                  the process is vulnerable to performance
                  failures. The results from these analyses lead to
                  validated and improved process models that are then
                  used to generate context-sensitive, dynamic
                  &ldquo;smart&rdquo; checklists. Future work will evaluate
                  whether the introduction of dynamic checklists based
                  on these models will reduce the number and severity
                  of errors in cardiac surgery.

The insider threat is one of the most pernicious in
                  computer security. Traditional approaches typically
                  instrument systems with decoys or intrusion
                  detection mechanisms to detect individuals who abuse
                  their privileges (the quintessential
                  &ldquo;insider&rdquo;). Such an attack requires that these
                  agents have access to resources or data in order to
                  corrupt or disclose them. In this work, we examine
                  the application of process modeling and subsequent
                  analyses to the insider problem. With process
                  modeling, we first describe how a process works in
                  formal terms. We then look at the agents who are
                  carrying out particular tasks, perform different
                  analyses to determine how the process can be
                  compromised, and suggest countermeasures that can be
                  incorporated into the process model to improve its
                  resistance to insider attack.

Medical device requirements often depend on the
                  healthcare processes in which the device is to be
                  used. Since such processes may be complex, critical
                  requirements may be specified inaccurately, or even
                  missed altogether. We are investigating an automated
                  requirement derivation approach that takes as input
                  a model of the healthcare process along with a model
                  of the device and tries to derive the requirements
                  for that device. Our initial experience with this
                  approach has shown that when the process and device
                  involve complex behaviors, the derived requirements
                  are also often complex and difficult to
                  understand. In this paper, we describe an approach
                  for creating a modal abstraction view of the derived
                  requirements that decomposes each requirement based
                  on it.

Medical errors are a major cause of unnecessary

                  for automatically

                  set of recommended ways to perform that
                  process. Such deviations could represent errors and,
                  thus, detecting and reporting deviations as they
                  occur could help catch errors before something bad
                  happens. This paper presents the proposed deviation

 Using process elicitation and validation to understand and improve
  chemotherapy ordering and delivery.
 <em>The Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety</em>,
  38(11):497&#x2013;505, November 2012.
<blockquote><font size="-1">
Background: Chemotherapy ordering and administration,
                  in which errors have potentially severe
                  consequences, was quantitatively and qualitatively
                  evaluated by employing process formalism (or formal
                  process definition), a technique derived from
                  software engineering, to elicit and rigorously
                  describe the process, after which validation
                  techniques were applied to confirm the accuracy of
                  the described process. <p>
                  Methods: The chemotherapy ordering and
                  administration process, including exceptional
                  situations and individuals' recognition of and
                  responses to those situations, was elicited through
                  informal, unstructured interviews with members of an
                  interdisciplinary team. The process description (or
                  process definition), written in a notation developed
                  for software quality assessment purposes, guided
                  process validation (which consisted of direct
                  observations and semistructured interviews to
                  confirm the elicited details for the treatment plan
                  portion of the process). <p>
                  Results: The overall process definition yielded 467
                  steps; 207 steps (44%) were dedicated to handling
                  59 exceptional situations. Validation yielded 82
                  unique process events (35 new expected but not yet
                  described steps, 16 new exceptional situations,
                  and 31 new steps in response to exceptional
                  situations). Process participants actively altered
                  the process as ambiguities and conflicts were
                  discovered by the elicitation and validation
                  components of the study. Chemotherapy error rates
                  declined significantly during and after the project,
                  which was conducted from October 2007 through August
                  2008. <p>
                  Discussion: Each elicitation method and the
                  subsequent validation discussions contributed
                  uniquely to understanding the chemotherapy
                  treatment plan review process, supporting rapid
                  adoption of changes, improved communication
                  regarding the process, and ensuing error reduction.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
One goal of medical device certification is to show
                  that a given  medical device satisfies its
                  requirements. But the requirements that should be
                  met by such a device depend on the clinical
                  processes in which the device is to be used, and
                  such processes are increasingly large and
                  complex. Critical requirements may thus be specified
                  inaccurately or incompletely, or even missed
                  altogether, and the use of the devices may lead to
                  harm. Thus, we investigated a process-based
                  requirement derivation approach that inputs a model
                  that captures a particular medical process and a
                  requirement that should be satisfied by that
                  process, and outputs a derived requirement of the
                  medical device that is sufficient to prevent any
                  violations of the process requirement. Our approach
                  combines an approach for generating assumptions for
                  assume-guarantee reasoning with one for interface
                  synthesis to automate the derivation of the medical
                  device requirements. The proposed approach
                  iteratively performs the requirement derivation by
                  employing a model checker and a learning
                  algorithm. We implemented this approach and
                  evaluated our approach by applying it to two small
                  case studies. Our experiences showed that the
                  proposed approach could be successfully applied to
                  abstract models of portions of real medical
                  processes and that the derived requirements of the
                  medical devices appeared useful and understandable.

This paper provides an overview of the

                  been developing and evaluating tools and technology
                  for modeling and analyzing medical processes. We
                  describe the tools that currently  comprise the
                  Process Improvement Environment, PIE.  For each
                  tool, we illustrate the kinds of information that it
                  provides and discuss how that information can be
                  used to improve the modeled process as well as
                  provide useful information that other tools in the
                  environment can leverage. Because the process
                  modeling notation that we use has rigorously defined
                  semantics and supports creating relatively detailed
                  process models (for example, our models can specify
                  alternative ways of dealing with exceptional
                  behavior and concurrency), a number of powerful
                  analysis techniques can be applied. The cost of
                  eliciting and maintaining such a detailed model is
                  amortized over the range of analyses that can be
                  applied to detect errors, vulnerabilities, and
                  inefficiencies in an existing process or in proposed
                  process modifications before they are deployed.

Many processes are safety critical and therefore
                  could benefit from proactive safety analysis
                  techniques that attempt to identify weaknesses of
                  such processes before they are put into use. In this
                  paper, we propose an approach that automatically
                  derives Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA)
                  information from processes modeled in the Little-JIL
                  process definition language. Typically FMEA
                  information is created manually by skilled experts,
                  an approach that is usually considered to be
                  time-consuming, error-prone, and tedious when
                  applied to complex processes. Although great care
                  must be taken in creating an accurate process
                  definition, with our approach this definition can
                  then be used to create FMEA representations for a
                  wide range of potential failures. In addition, our
                  approach provides a complementary Fault Tree
                  Analysis (FTA), thereby supporting two of the most
                  widely used safety analysis techniques.

This report will present a collection of tools that
                  supports the precise definition, careful analysis,
                  and execution of processes that coordinate the
                  actions of humans, automated devices, and software
                  systems for the delivery of health care. The tools
                  have been developed over the past several years and
                  are currently being evaluated through their
                  application to four health care processes, blood
                  transfusion, chemotherapy, emergency department
                  operations, and identity verification. The tools are
                  integrated with each other using the Eclipse
                  framework or through the sharing of artifacts so
                  that the internal representations generated by one
                  might be used to expedite the actions of
                  others. This integrated collection of tools is
                  intended to support the continuous improvement of
                  health care delivery processes. The process
                  definitions developed through this framework are
                  executable and are intended for eventual use in
                  helping to guide actual health care workers in the
                  performance of their activities, including the
                  utilization of medical devices and information systems.

Motivation: The complex nature of health care processes
                  requires new methods for describing, capturing and
                  improving these processes. Research approach: We
                  deployed a novel combination of methods&#x2014;formal
                  process modeling using a language called Little-JIL,
                  simulations with embedded errors, observations, and
                  eye tracking technology&#x2014;to gauge how health care
                  providers complete one complex process, patient
                  identification. Findings/Design: These methods
                  allowed us to thoroughly analyze how health care
                  providers completed the patient identification
                  process with and without embedded errors, and to
                  record exactly what participants looked at during
                  the simulations. Research limitations/Implications:
                  We have used this set of methods to analyze only one
                  type of health care process
                  to-date. Originality/Value: We can use these 
                  approaches to inform health care provider training,
                  process redesign, and the design of technologies to
                  support health care providers as they verify
                  patients' identities.

 Computer scientists use a number of
                  well-established techniques that have the potential
                  to improve the safety of patient care processes. One
                  is the <em>formal definition of the properties of
                  a process</em>.  Even highly regulated processes, such
                  as laboratory specimen acquisition and transfusion
                  therapy, use guidelines that may be vague,
                  misunderstood, and hence erratically
                  implemented. Examining processes in a systematic way
                  has led us to appreciate the potential variability
                  in routine health care practical and the impact of
                  this variability on patient safety in the clinical
                  setting.  The purpose of this article is to discuss
                  the use of innovative computer science techniques as
                  a means of formally defining and specifying certain
                  desirable goals of common, high-risk, patient care
                  processes.  Our focus is on describing the
                  specification of process <em>properties</em>, that is,
                  the high-level goals of a process that ultimately
                  dictate why a process should be performed in a given

 In this paper, we describe some of the key observations resulting
            from our work on using software engineering technologies
                  to help detect errors in medical processes. In many
                  ways, medical processes are similar to distributed
                  systems in their complexity and proneness to contain
                  errors. We have been investigating the application
                  of a continuous process improvement approach to
                  medical processes in which detailed and semantically
                  rich models of the medical processes are created and
                  then subjected to rigorous analyses. The
                  technologies we applied helped improve understanding
                  about the processes and led to the detection of
                  errors and subsequent improvements to those
                  processes. This work is still preliminary, but is
                  suggesting new research directions for medical
                  process improvement, software engineering
                  technologies, and the applicability of these

The administration of blood products is a common,
                  resource intensive, potentially problem-prone area
                  that may place patients at elevated risk in the
                  clinical setting. Much of the emphasis in
                  transfusion safety has been targeted towards quality
                  control measures in laboratory settings where blood
                  products are prepared for administration as well as
                  in automation of certain laboratory processes. In
                  contrast, the process of transfusing blood in the
                  clinical setting (i.e., at the point of care) has
                  essentially remained unchanged over the past several
                  decades.<p>
                  Many of the currently available
                  methods for improving the quality and safety of
                  blood transfusions in the clinical setting rely on
                  informal process descriptions, such as flow charts
                  and medical algorithms, to describe medical
                  processes. These informal descriptions, while useful
                  in presenting an overview of standard processes, can
                  be ambiguous or incomplete. For example, they often
                  describe only the standard process and leave out how
                  to handle possible failures or exceptions.<p>
                  One
                  alternative to these informal descriptions is to use
                  formal process definitions, which can serve as the
                  basis for a variety of analyses because these formal
                  definitions offer precision in the representation of
                  all possible ways that a process can be carried out
                  in both standard and exceptional situations. Formal
                  process definitions have not previously been used to
                  describe and improve medical processes. The use of
                  such formal definitions to prospectively identify
                  potential error and improve the transfusion process
                  has not previously been reported.  <p>
                  The purpose
                  of this paper is to introduce the concept of
                  formally defining processes and to describe how
                  formal definitions of blood transfusion processes
                  can be used to detect and correct transfusion
                  process errors in ways not currently possible using
                  existing quality improvement methods.

Defects in safety critical processes can lead to accidents that result
in harm to people or damage to property.  Therefore, it is important to
find ways to detect and remove defects from such processes. Earlier
work has shown that Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) can be effective in
detecting safety critical process defects.  Unfortunately, it is
difficult to build a comprehensive set of Fault Trees for a complex
process, especially if this process is not completely
well-defined.  The Little-JIL process definition language has been
shown to be effective for defining complex processes clearly and
precisely at whatever level of granularity is desired. In this
work, we present an algorithm for generating Fault Trees from
Little-JIL process definitions. We demonstrate the value of this work
by showing how FTA can identify safety defects in the process from
which the Fault Trees were automatically derived.
