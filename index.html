<H3>WMMP:</H3> I was the lead Principal Investigator on a project
called the Western Massachusetts Mathematics Partnership.  In 2011,
this project was funded by a "START" planning grant from the National
Science Foundation's Math and Science Partnerships program, and it
continues to operate with funding from Five Colleges, Incorporated, and the
participating school districts.  The WMMP involves faculty from all
the member institutions of the Five College Consortium (Amherst,
Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, and Smith colleges and UMass Amherst),
Springfield College, Holyoke Community College, Greenfield Community
College and Western New England and Westfield State universities.  The
school districts participating include Amherst, Easthampton,
Gill-Montague, Hampden-Wilbraham, Holyoke, Mohawk Trail, Northampton,
Pioneer Valley Performing Arts Charter School, South Hadley,
Springfield, Union 28, and Westfield.  In addition to Summer
Institutes where WMMP participants discuss issues in mathematics
teaching and work on mathematics together, we have also been
sponsoring vertically integrated (K-16) Professional Learning
Communities focused on algebraic thinking and the Common Core practice
standards.  In the spring of 2015, I co-facilitated a PLC with
Jennifer Oliver, a math teacher at the Amherst Regional Middle School,
and Harriet Pollatsek, a professor emerita at Mount Holyoke.  In the
fall of 2015, I co-facilitated a PLC with Claudine Margolis, a math
teacher at PVPA.<p>
