 Combining symbolic execution with model checking to verify parallel

<blockquote><font size="-1">
We present a method to verify the correctness of parallel
             programs that perform complex numerical computations,
             including computations involving floating-point
             arithmetic.  This method requires that a sequential
             version of the program be provided, to serve as the
             specification for the parallel one.  The key idea is 
             to use model checking, together with symbolic execution, to
             establish the equivalence of the two programs.  In this approach
             the path condition from symbolic execution of the sequential
             program is used to constrain the search through the parallel
             program.  To handle floating-point operations, three different
             types of equivalence are supported. Several examples are
             presented, demonstrating the approach and actual errors that were
             found.  Limitations and directions for future research are also
             described.

 Verification of halting properties for MPI programs using

<blockquote><font size="-1">
We show that many important properties of certain
                  MPI programs can be verified by considering only a
                  class of executions in which all communication takes
                  place synchronously. In previous work, we showed
                  that similar results hold for MPI programs that use
                  only blocking communication (and avoid certain other
                  constructs, such as <tt>MPI_ANYSOURCE</tt>); in this
                  paper we show that the same conclusions hold for
                  programs that also use the nonblocking functions
                  <tt>MPI_ISEND</tt>, <tt>MPI_IRECV</tt>, and
                  <tt>MPI_WAIT</tt>. These facts can be used to
                  dramatically reduce the number of states explored
                  when using model checking techniques to verify
                  properties such as freedom from deadlock in such
                  programs.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
In this paper, we discuss some preliminary results
                  in applying finite-state verification techniques to
                  high performance parallel codes, with a particular
                  emphasis on scientific programs that employ the
                  widely-used Message Passing Interface (MPI). These
                  results suggest that such techniques may have
                  significant potential for improving both the
                  productivity of developers of parallel scientific
                  programs and the quality of those programs. We also
                  briefly sketch some of the research issues that must
                  be addressed to achieve that potential.

 Verification of MPI-based software for scientific computation.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
We explore issues related to the application of
                  finite-state verification techniques to scientific
                  computation software employing the widely-used
                  Message-Passing Interface (MPI).  Many of the
                  features of MPI that are important for programmers
                  present significant difficulties for model checking.
                  In this paper, we examine a small parallel program
                  that computes the evolution in time of a discretized
                  function <em>u</em> defined on a 2-dimensional
                  domain and governed by the diffusion equation.
                  Although this example is simple, it makes use of
                  many of the problematic features of MPI.  We discuss
                  the modeling of these features and use Spin and INCA
                  to verify several correctness properties for various
                  configurations of this program. Finally, we describe
                  some general theorems that can be used to justify
                  simplifications in finite-state models of MPI
                  programs and that guarantee certain properties must
                  hold for any program using only a particular subset
                  of MPI.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
We investigate the application of formal
                  verification techniques to parallel programs that
                  employ the Message Passing Interface (MPI).  We
                  develop a formal model of a subset of MPI, and then
                  prove a number of theorems about that model that
                  ameliorate or eliminate altogether the state
                  explosion problem.  As an example, we show that if
                  one wishes to verify freedom from deadlock, it
                  suffices to consider only synchronous executions.
