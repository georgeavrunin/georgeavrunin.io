<blockquote><font size="-1">
In software architecture, components represent the
                  computational units of a system and connectors
                  represent the interactions among those units. Making
                  decisions about the semantics of these interactions
                  is a key part of the design process. It is often
                  difficult, however, to choose the appropriate
                  interaction semantics due to the wide range of
                  alternatives and the complexity of the system
                  behavior affected by those choices. Techniques such
                  as finite-state verification can be used to evaluate
                  the impact of these design choices on the overall
                  system behavior. <p>
                  This paper presents the Plug-and-Play approach that
                  allows designers to experiment with alternative
                  design choices of component interactions in a
                  plug-and-play manner. With this approach, connectors
                  representing specific interaction semantics are
                  composed from a library of predefined, reusable
                  building blocks. In addition, standard interfaces
                  for components are defined that reduce the impact of
                  interaction changes on the componentsâ€™
                  computations. This approach facilitates design-time
                  verification by improving the reusability of
                  component models and by providing reusable formal
                  models for the connector building blocks, thereby
                  reducing model-construction time for finite-state
                  verification.

One of the distinguishing features of distributed systems is the
importance of the interaction mechanisms that are used to define how
the sequential components interact with each other. Given the
complexity of the behavior that is being described and the large
design space of various alternatives, choosing appropriate interaction
mechanisms is difficult. In this paper, we propose a component-based
specification approach that allows designers to experiment with
alternative interaction semantics. Our approach is also integrated
with design-time verification to provide feedback about the
correctness of the overall system design. In this approach, connectors
representing specific interaction semantics are composed from reusable
building blocks. Standard communication interfaces for components are
defined to reduce the impact of changing interactions on components'
computations. The increased reusability of both components and
connectors also allows savings at model-construction time for
finite-state verification.

 Verification support for plug-and-play architectural design.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
In software architecture, components are intended to
                  represent the computational units of the system and
                  connectors are intended to represent the
                  interactions between those units. Choosing the
                  semantics of these interactions is a key part of the
                  design process, but the wide range of alternatives
                  from which to choose and the complexity of the
                  behavior affected by the choices makes it difficult
                  to get them right. We propose an approach in
                  which connectors with particular semantics are
                  constructed from a library of pre-defined building
                  blocks. Changes in the semantics of a connector can
                  be accomplished by adding new building blocks to the
                  connector, or by removing or replacing some of its
                  existing building blocks. In our approach, a small
                  set of standard interfaces allows components to
                  communicate with each other through a wide variety
                  of connectors, so the impact on components for even
                  substantial changes in the semantics of the
                  connectors is minimized. <p>
                  In this paper, we focus on the way this approach
                  supports design-time verification to provide
                  feedback about the correctness of the design. By
                  enhancing the re-use of models of both components
                  and connectors, this approach has the potential to
                  significantly reduce the cost of verification as a
                  design evolves.

 Architectural building blocks for plug-and-play system design.

One of the distinguishing features of distributed
                  systems is the importance of the interaction
                  mechanisms that are used to define how the
                  sequential components interact with each
                  other. Given the complexity of the behavior that is
                  being described and the large design space of
                  various alternatives from which to choose, choosing
                  appropriate interaction mechanisms is usually
                  difficult. In this paper, we propose a compositional
                  specification approach that facilitates
                  experimentation with alternative interaction
                  semantics. In this approach, connectors representing
                  specific interaction semantics are composed from
                  predefined building blocks and a standard component
                  interface and protocol are defined. Such an approach
                  reduces the impact of change, since components often
                  do not have to change when the interaction semantics
                  are changed. This approach also facilitates
                  design-time verification, since abstract models of
                  the unchanged components and of the building blocks
                  can often be reused. We evaluate our approach by
                  defining building blocks for a family of message
                  passing mechanisms and present several versions of
                  an example that use different message passing
                  semantics from this family. The example illustrates
                  how this approach supports "plug-and-play" system
                  design and verification.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
In this paper we demonstrate how static concurrency analysis
techniques can be used to verify application-specific properties of
an architectural description.  Specifically, we use two concurrency
analysis tools, INCA, a flow equation based tool, and FLAVERS, a
data flow analysis based tool, to detect errors or prove properties
of a Wright architectural description of the gas station problem.
Although both these tools are research prototypes, they illustrate
the potential of static analysis for verifying that architectural
descriptions adhere to important properties,  for detecting
problems early in the lifecycle, and for helping developers understand
the changes that need to be made to satisfy the properties being
analyzed.
